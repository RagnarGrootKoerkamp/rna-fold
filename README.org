#+TITLE: A* RNA-Folding

An exploration/failed attempt of RNA folding using A*, similar to [[A*PA][https://github.com/ragnargrootkoerkamp/astar-pairwise-aligner]].

I considered the simplest variant where the number of matched complementary
characters is maximized, and no other penalties/scores.

It turns out that in this setting, the score of the optimal alignment of random
strings is actually quite high and close to the score of the optimal alignment
of strings with structure. This means that it will be hard to exploit structure
to improve the alignment, and A* can not easily disregard alignments of noisy
regions without.
